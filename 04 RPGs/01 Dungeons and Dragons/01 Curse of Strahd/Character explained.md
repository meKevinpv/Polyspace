## Ori's tale

Ori is a Divine soul sorcerer fairy, 26 years old and standing. Though for commonfolk to meet a fairy is a *once in a lifetime* event, among fairies she can easily be recognized by the luminescent organ called the lux that bungees above her head, and her large, elf-like ears. With Periwrinkle colored skin and deep ocean-blue hair that seems to have highlights by the way her light blue luminescent pointy-hornet like wings. 

> **“They say if you dream a thing more than once, it’s sure to come true.”**
> ~ Charles Perrault, 'Sleeping Beauty'.

She usually lives in the forest hardly ever interacting with people, however, there are some families that know the stories of the existence of a forest sprite are at least, in part, true. These families didn't randomly stumble upon Ori, nor did they look for her, they were chosen. Ori spends her days looking after the bugs and animals living under the cover of the leaves, and, it is in the care of these creatures these families showed heart and it is then Ori is willing to show. 

> **“Just living is not enough,” said the butterfly, “one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.”**
> ~ Hans Christian Andersen, ‘The Complete Fairy Tales.’

From children that stopped their parents stepping on a ladybug to innocent commonfolk who helped Ori by opening the steal claws that and ropes that held anything from a hare to a bear, she is very willing to approach once.

## Seren's tale

Seren's tale is the story of how Ori and Seren met and later became friends.

---

*As the rain trickled on the canopy of leaves above,
all was well on the floor of the forest as Ori looked up and saw a dove.
BANG!%&# THUNDER AND LIGHTNING ROARED as it descended the tree,
The dove, struck and roasted, following thee.
As the electricity sparked the foot of a fey,
a scared young explorer made it's way:
Through forests, with falling branches and a dead bird below,
the real horror struck  as young Seren the nest, the fate of it's eggs: he'd know.
Were it not for him, with clouds above,
Seeing a young fey attempt to spark its' light on mother dove.
Her wings flapped no more, as Seren showed the teensy fey her eggs up high,
"We need to care for them", their voices cried.
Soaring up the fairy went, only knowing to slow down the eggs descent.
Caught by the giant called Seren, the fey wondered if he had a plan.
She did as she got on her feet, carrying the nest with a tired fairy inside as she knew where this road would lead..
No longer a scared fairy in the forest, now choosing to meet with men.
For it THEM to safe the birds, now way back when.*

*My friend in need of mine, thine, and theirs.
Thank you for everything,
Ori*

## Rumors

To create fun characters, 3 rumors were written about each character. One is true, one is overexaggerated and one is just that, a rumor.

>**“But wishes are only granted in fairy tales.”**
>~ Simone Elkeles, Perfect Chemistry

___
1. **True** I heard somewhere that you killed a man once by barelling into a his stomach and coming out the other end. The story as to why varies: the man refused to share his food with you, insulted you somehow or you were after one of his valuables. *A local hunter once wounded a deer late dusk, he couldn't find his prey and after - what I consider - too little effort gave up his search. The deer died, and the man was tragically struck by lightning on a clear day.*
2. **False,** Your best friend is a dark fairy; you’re convinced you can convert them to do good. *My best friend is a honeybee named Atsy.*
3. **Greatly overexaggerated,** You have a paralysing fear of birds *This only applies to Ravens*.
