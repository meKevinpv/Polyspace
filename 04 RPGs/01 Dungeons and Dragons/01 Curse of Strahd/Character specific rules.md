## Ori specific rules
To better support Ori being a truly Tiny character, the following rules are implemented:
#### Custom fairy features
 1. **Ori can be grappled by a Sleight of Hand (DEX) check, but, if you use normal grapple checks she has advantage on avoiding the grapple.**
Due to her size, Ori is ridiculously hard to get a hold of. However, once you have her, she is very easy to hold. Because of rule change 2.

 2. **Ori can only escape grapples by Athletics (STR) checks, as manouvres don't work if you are tiny compared to normal sized creatures.**
This locks ori into using her weakest stats to contest possible strong stats, making her often not even willing to escape grapples as it's almost impossible.

 3. **Ori cannot wield armour, carry a weapon or a backpack.**
She is to small for any of them. She could just barely hold a toothpick. She only has a casting amulet that she wears without which, she is magically incapable.

 4. **Ori can hide in and small containers like backpacks, chests and barrels.**
She is small enough to fit, and will hardly make a sound

 5. **Ori has a +2 magical extra bonus to Stealth, traded for another -4 disadvantage to Athletics.**
This makes sense due to her build.

 6. **Ori has a and +4 magical extra bonus to Nature, traded for a -2 disadvantage to STR saving throws**
This makes sense to trade her knowledge for something she never practiced.
