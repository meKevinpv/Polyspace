## Themes
#### Fairytales
Ori's life before the adventure is described as a fairytale. She **sees her enemies as villains** that she should protect her forest friends against. She loves spending evenings *writing these tales* on small pieces of parchment that she hands out to her friends.
#### Thunder
Together with other fairy sorcerers, Ori would be capable of **controlling weather is a small area**, her specialty is Thunder. This shows in multiple ways, from spells having *decorative thunderous effects*,  Ori's *touch feeling static* and even *lightning strikes sending jolts back up* to spark her in the air.
#### Nature
Ori thanks her magical power to *nature and it's violent weather*. She feels better in storms and feels responsible to **protect those who are struck by bad weather**. This includes her *animal friends* that live in the forest, which, she takes care of on a daily basis.

## Religion
#### Aerdrie Faenya
Whenever natural rain occurs Ori will thank the *Bringer of Rain and Storms*. Altough there is little known about *Aerdrie Faenya*, she has learned to follow her teaching in enjoying the air move around her. Semianually (on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes) she enjoys the *aerial ballet*, as others hide inside from the strong winds, she prays and celebrates the changing of the seasons in honor of Aedrie by performing her own **Dance of the Swirling Winds**.
