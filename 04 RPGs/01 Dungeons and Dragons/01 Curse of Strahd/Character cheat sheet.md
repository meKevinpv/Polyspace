## Themes
#### Fairytales
Ori's life before the adventure is described as a fairytale. She **sees her enemies as villains** that she should protect her forest friends against. She loves spending evenings *writing these tales* on small pieces of parchment that she hands out to her friends.
#### Thunder
Together with other fairy sorcerers, Ori would be capable of **controlling weather is a small area**, her specialty is Thunder. This shows in multiple ways, from spells having *decorative thunderous effects*,  Ori's *touch feeling static* and even *lightning strikes sending jolts back up* to spark her in the air.
#### Nature
Ori thanks her magical power to *nature and it's violent weather*. She feels better in storms and feels responsible to **protect those who are struck by bad weather**. This includes her *animal friends* that live in the forest, which, she takes care of on a daily basis. 

## People & partners
#### Atsy, the honeybee

#### Seren

## Religion
#### Aerdrie Faenya
Whenever natural rain occurs Ori will thank the *Bringer of Rain and Storms*. Altough there is little known about *Aerdrie Faenya*, she has learned to follow her teaching in enjoying the air move around her. Semianually (on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes) she enjoys the *aerial ballet*, as others hide inside from the strong winds, she prays and celebrates the changing of the seasons in honor of Aedrie by performing her own **Dance of the Swirling Winds**.

## Rumors
1. **True** I heard somewhere that you killed a man once by barelling into a his stomach and coming out the other end. The story as to why varies: the man refused to share his food with you, insulted you somehow or you were after one of his valuables. *A local hunter once wounded a deer late dusk, he couldn't find his prey and after - what I consider - too little effort gave up his search. The deer died, and the man was tragically struck by lightning on a clear day.*
2. **False,** Your best friend is a dark fairy; youâ€™re convinced you can convert them to do good. *My best friend is a honeybee named Atsy.*
3. **Greatly overexaggerated,** You have a paralysing fear of birds *This only applies to Ravens*.
