## Preperations

## Notes
Ori is a Divine soul sorcerer fairy, 26 years old and standing 

#### Custom fairy features
 1. **Ori can be grappled by a Sleight of Hand (DEX) check, but, if you use normal grapple checks she has advantage on avoiding the grapple.**
Due to her size, Ori is ridiculously hard to get a hold of. However, once you have her, she is very easy to hold. Because of rule change 2.

 2. **Ori can only escape grapples by Athletics (STR) checks, as manouvres don't work if you are tiny compared to normal sized creatures.**
This locks ori into using her weakest stats to contest possible strong stats, making her often not even willing to escape grapples as it's almost impossible.

 3. **Ori cannot wield armour, carry a weapon or a backpack.**
She is to small for any of them. She could just barely hold a toothpick. She only has a casting amulet that she wears without which, she is magically incapable.

 4. **Ori can hide in and small containers like backpacks, chests and barrels.**
She is small enough to fit, and will hardly make a sound

 5. **Ori has a +2 magical extra bonus to Stealth, traded for another -4 disadvantage to Athletics.**
This makes sense due to her build.

 6. **Ori has a and +4 magical extra bonus to Nature, traded for a -2 disadvantage to STR saving throws**
This makes sense to trade her knowledge for something she never practiced.

## Rumors

To create fun characters, 3 rumors were written about each character. One is true, one is overexaggerated and one is just that, a rumor.

>**“But wishes are only granted in fairy tales.”**
>~ Simone Elkeles, Perfect Chemistry

___
1. **True** I heard somewhere that you killed a man once by barelling into a his stomach and coming out the other end. The story as to why varies: the man refused to share his food with you, insulted you somehow or you were after one of his valuables. *A local hunter once wounded a deer late dusk, he couldn't find his prey and after - what I consider - too little effort gave up his search. The deer died, and the man was tragically struck by lightning on a clear day.*
2. **False,** Your best friend is a dark fairy; you’re convinced you can convert them to do good. *My best friend is a honeybee named Atsy.*
3. **Greatly overexaggerated,** You have a paralysing fear of birds *This only applies to Ravens*.

## The Party
The party's basis is a good "We are against evil" type of deal.
#### Dominic Sebastián Yatra
Human Bard
#### Nadjah
Human Paladin
#### Seren of Anderlin
Human Fighter
#### Rogue Bas
Genasi Rogue

## Shared Rumors
1. **To Seren**, you are noble only by title, your mind constantly hungers for agression and you've started regional conflicts because of it.
2. **To Nadjah**, your impulsive goodness has once gone to far, you unseathed a sword on a child when telling it not to steal fruit, only barely not striking when someone saw you.
