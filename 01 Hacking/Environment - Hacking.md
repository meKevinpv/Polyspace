# My hacking environment
This note will explain what tools/software I use, how I use that, and why I use it. Most of your environment is personal preference, however, similar people have similar preferences in working environments. 

## Operating System: Kali Linux
Kali Linux is an industustry-standard operating system for hackers. During [[About me#Work Experience|my internship at Kiwa]] I had to validate my tools to meet required lab standards, and, others there also worked with Kali so it stuck.

If you want to learn more about the basics of Kali Linux and hacking I really recommend the free (both in spirit and price) learning method of [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)

## Reconnaisance tools
I have grown to dislike heavy tools like autorecon, eventough I understand the value they provide. This is why I use [nmap](https://nmap.org/), [searchsploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit) and [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster). These 3 tools provide the nessecary information I need to understand the basic idea of what is happening on the system I am trying to hack into.
