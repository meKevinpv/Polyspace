Welcome to the personal notes of Kevin Veldman üñä. This vault showcases how my ideas convert into notes, projects and knowledge. 

This website is the latest release version of my vault. Would you like to keep up with changes as I: Learn new things, create new Dungeons & Dragons sessions and build new Magic the Gathering decks? Please refer to the `Continuous` branch on my [Github](https://github.com/meKevinpv/Polyspace).

*If you are a player in one of my Dungeons & Dragons campaigns* **DO NOT READ** anything in the `04 RPGs` folder, it is littered with spoilers, themes and plans I have for campaigns.

## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùì
**Why are these notes so chaotic?** These notes are primarily organized in a way they work for me. These notes contain my unfiltered, unscientific, and sometimes outright wrong asumptions and thoughts. 

**What is the most important note/thought?** The most important thing is taking notes, if you want to learn and remember many things you're inevitably going to forget things. Taking notes is a way to create a second brain, so technically, you are mindreading by delving down here.

**What is your obsidian configuration?** If you download the `.zip` file you can see it. But, for those who just want the quick read: I use Kepano's wonderful Minimal theme with a small font size. Safe mode on and I use Templates for my *Dungeons & Dragons* notes.
