# Polyspace ðŸš€
Welcome to Polyspace. Here, my thoughts float around.

## Using this repository
There are many reasons someone might venture here. From reading lore about my Dungeons & Dragons adventures to looking at how I work through Hack the Box machines. All files in here are written in Obsidian using the `.md` (Markdown) file extension. 

## Future plans for this repository
- [ ] Autosync my [website](www.kevinpv.com) with this vault
- [ ] Collaborate on Dungeons & Dragons projects

## Goals for next release (Changelog on live)
- [ ] Write [[About me]]
- [ ] Expanded [[02 Programming/Goals for 2022]]
- [ ] Migrate most recent RPG Systems into new [[Dungeons and Dragons Session]] template
