# Writeup - Tailwind
Tailwind is a css framework that uses a class syntax that is very similar to pure css but it guides you into using good habits like `rem` for font size. This way you are almost forced into using best practices and it even automates tasks for you like minimizing your css.

Tailwind is **not** a css framework to fully give styling like a navbar, you will have to create that yourself, **however** it does provide a more usable and quickly customizable way of editing it.
