# Goals
At the beginning of 2022 I have defined the following goals for myself. ðŸš€
- [ ] Flutter
> I am hearing a lot of positives about flutter, and time has come to check it out.

- [ ] Scripting Linux configurations in Python
> I use a lot of Virtual machines, but, I want to have something I can use for both physical and virtual machines that instantly loads my settings for terminal, desktop and maybe even my other editors.

- [ ] Set-up own webstack
> I think learning some of the web frameworks well could help me get more productive, but, I will need an assignment if I want to actually start doing this, else it feels like a waste of time.

- [ ] Learning more raw css
> I've often used frameworks, and found they often don't provide what I want for my designs, so I want to make some websites in raw CSS or maybe scss to get more familiar with it.

- [ ] Set up instant import VScode file
> Having to set up time ang time again has gotten tiresome.

- [ ] Try Neovim
> Using Kali Linux for [[Environment - Hacking | Hacking]] I've really grown to love VIM, so maybe Neovim will sit well with me.

- [ ] Try Switch to some Linux version for programming
> This only doesn't work well for c# with me, and that's a language I rarely ever use anymore. I think it could really help out my productivity to switch my (home) windows system over to Linux again.
